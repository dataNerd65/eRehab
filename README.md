# eRehab
# Made with Intellij Ultimate's Jakarta EE
Sometimes in our lives we are faced with struggles. We seek help but cannot find what we are looking for. That person that would always be there for you in your struggles is illusive sometimes but that doesn't make up the fact that we undermine human help. It is just that other people also have their lives to live hence we sometimes feel they are not with us. But a step to reach out to them once in a while really saves a lot. But here comes tech which is helping us in our daily life and making impacts everywhere and most uprising is AI, a new era where machines come to 'life'. But as i have said, human connections are the key. My program here is eRehab, a platform to help individuals who are addicts of drugs, gaming, pornography etc. It seeks to help in daily reviews of ones actions, reaching out to help eg professional one or the dearly accountability partners. Join me in my journey through this software and youll love it.
First the portal face made with java server pages files(index.jsp) with stylings of course.
